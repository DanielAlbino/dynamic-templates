# Architecture

I'm using a modular React architecture with a component-based design, which is a common and effective structure for React applications. React applications typically follow a component-based architecture, where each file/folder structure reflects a UI component or a set of related components.


# Good practices

Since I'm working with React/Typescript was necessary to make sure that every variable and function has its own type/interface, this way we can meke sure that the variable/function will only receive the correct parameters.

Added some comments when necessary, this helps understand the code.

Clean code - meaning that the code is understandable at first look.


# Bad practice

In the project I'm adding the styles-in-line, means that I'm adding the style of a component in the component itself instead of creating a css file and call it as a class. but since this is a very small project, I let this one pass, but I know that in every project we must have things organized and splitted, add the css on the css file and called the necessary classes.
